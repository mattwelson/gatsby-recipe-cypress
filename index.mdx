Gatsby and Cypress can be used together seamlessly (and should be!). [Cypress](https://cypress.io) enables you to run end-to-end tests on your client-side application, which is what Gatsby produces.

First, we'll want to install Cypress and additional dependencies.

---

<NPMPackage name="cypress" dependencyType="development" />
<NPMPackage name="gatsby-cypress" dependencyType="development" />
<NPMPackage name="start-server-and-test" dependencyType="development" />
<NPMPackage name="@testing-library/cypress" dependencyType="development" />

---

Well look at that â€” we've added dependencies to your package.json and we also installed a useful package `gatsby-cypress`. `gatsby-cypress` exposes additional Cypress functionality which makes Gatsby and Cypress work together just a bit more nicely. We'll show that later with our first test, but hold tight for just a bit because first we need to scaffold out some boilerplate files for Cypress.

<NPMScript name="develop" command="gatsby develop" />

<NPMScript name="cy:open" command="cypress open" />

<NPMScript
  name="test:e2e"
  command="start-server-and-test develop http://localhost:8000 cy:open"
/>

Nifty! We've added two scripts:

- `start-server-and-test`: This spins up a local Gatsby development server and "waits" until it's live so we can then run our tests
- `test:e2e`: This is the command you'll use to run your tests.

Let's give it a try. Run the following command in your terminal.

npm run test:e2e

Now you'll have a way to run and validate your Cypress tests with the dream-team combo of Gatsby and Cypress.
